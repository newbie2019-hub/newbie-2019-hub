I spent countless hours learning how a certain thing work, how to implement a feature and building personal projects, mostly by following tutorials on YouTube and searching for answers on StackOverflow. Over time, I realized how much I enjoyed the process of creating something from scratch."}]},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"What fascinated me the most was how being a developer constantly pushes you to learn—whether it’s understanding how something works or exploring new technologies.

It’s like building a personalized knowledge base—something I can refer back to when I need clarity or direction. By reflecting on my experiences and documenting my processes, I not only solidify my understanding but also make it easier to pick up where I left off.
